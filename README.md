## ft_containers Intro
  ```
In this project, you will implement a few container types of the C++ standard template
library.
You have to take the structure of each standard container as reference. If a part of
the Orthodox Canonical form is missing in it, do not implement it.
As a reminder, you have to comply with the C++98 standard, so any later feature of
the containers MUST NOT be implemented, but every C++98 feature (even deprecated
ones) is expected

### i did not complete this project cause of  :
```
On February 28th, 2023, we will start the transition in order to remove ft_containers from the
Common Core and add a module CPP 09 to use the C++ containers.

# Why ?

The common core is designed to develop the minimal set of skills for a first professional experience.
In such a context, the usage of the C++ containers does make sense as it can be needed
during internships, but recreating them is not part of the priorities. 

# How?

- The project group CPP-00 to CPP-08 is split into 2 parts.
- The CPP-00 to CPP-04 remain at their current position, on circle 4.
- The XP previously earned on CPP-08 is transferred to CPP-04 (9660 XP).
- The other modules CPP-05 to CPP08, plus the new CPP-09, replace ft_containers on the upper
 circle (circle 5).
- CPP-09 get the XP of ft_containers (10042 XP).

# Students Use Cases:

    - working before or on cpp04: the student will get the new path, with XP on cpp04 and cpp09.
 ft_container is no longer available.
    - working on cpp05-06-07-08: the student will get the XP on cpp04, and will have to complete other circle 4
requirements before moving on to the next cpp project. On circle 5, the student will complete the remaining cpp
modules, plus the new cpp-09. ft_containers will not be available.
   - working on other rank 4 projects: with cpp08 validated, the student will see the XP transferred to cpp04.
When the circle 4 is validated,
 the student will have access to cpp09 in replacement of ft_containers.
   - on circle 5, with ongoing or completed ft_containers: the student will stick to ft_containers and will
not have access to cpp09.
The cpp08 XP is transferred to cpp04.
   - on circle 5, with ft_containers not started: the student will only be able to register to cpp09.
The cpp08 XP is transferred to cpp04.

cause 2:
 i did not have enough blackhole days , so i decided to do cpp 09 to gain more blackhole days quickly
